#<h1>Before You Begin Tutorials

##<h1>What You'll Learn
This section assumes you've read Part 1 and understand the basic interface. Here you'll learn specific techniques through hands-on tutorials.

##<h1>Settings to Check First
Before starting the tutorials:
1. Click the ⚙️ <strong>Settings<strong> button
2. Under <strong>General Settings<strong>, make sure:
   - Language is set to your preference
   - Theme is comfortable for you
3. Under <strong>Drawing Settings<strong>, note:
   - Default strand width (try 46 pixels)
   - Default colors (you can change these anytime)
4. Click <strong>OK<strong> to close settings

#<h1>Tutorial 1: Creating Your First Simple Knot

<strong>What we're making<strong>: A basic overhand knot (the simplest knot)

##<h1>Step 1: Draw the Base Loop
1. Click <strong>Attach<strong> mode (first button)
2. Start near the left side of the canvas
3. Click and drag to create a curved line that loops around
4. End point should cross over the starting area
5. Release the mouse - you now have Layer 1

<em>Result: You should see a curved line with a loop<em>

##<h1>Step 2: Adjust the Shape
1. Click <strong>Move<strong> mode
2. Click anywhere on your strand to select it
3. You'll see small circles (control points) appear
4. Drag these circles to adjust the curve:
   - Pull them away from the strand for sharper curves
   - Move them closer for gentler curves
5. Drag the strand itself to reposition it

<em>Tip: Don't worry about perfection - you can always adjust later<em>

##<h1>Step 3: Create the Knot Effect
1. Click <strong>Mask<strong> mode
2. Click on your strand where it crosses over itself
3. This creates the "over/under" effect that makes it look like a real knot

##<h1>Step 4: Final Adjustments
1. Click <strong>Move<strong> mode again
2. Fine-tune the position and curves
3. Try <strong>Rotate<strong> mode to adjust the angle
4. Toggle <strong>Grid<strong> to help with alignment

##<h1>Step 5: Save Your Work
1. Click <strong>Save<strong>
2. Give it a name like "My First Knot"
3. Click <strong>OK<strong>

<strong>Congratulations!<strong> You've created your first knot pattern.

#<h1>Tutorial 2: Making a Three-Strand Braid

<strong>What we're making<strong>: A classic braid pattern with three parallel strands

##<h1>Step 1: Create the First Strand
1. Click <strong>Attach<strong> mode
2. Draw a gentle curve from top-left to bottom-right
3. Keep it fairly straight - this is the left strand of your braid

##<h1>Step 2: Add the Middle Strand  
1. Still in <strong>Attach<strong> mode
2. Draw another strand parallel to the first, but in the center
3. This creates Layer 2

##<h1>Step 3: Add the Right Strand
1. Draw the third strand on the right side
2. Keep all three roughly parallel
3. Now you have Layers 1, 2, and 3

##<h1>Step 4: Create the Braid Crossings
1. Click <strong>Attach<strong> mode again
2. Draw short connecting strands that cross between the main strands:
   - From left strand to middle (going over)
   - From right strand to middle (going over) 
   - From middle to left (going under)
   - From middle to right (going under)

##<h1>Step 5: Use Masks for Realistic Effect
1. Click <strong>Mask<strong> mode
2. Click on strands that should go "under" others
3. This creates the woven appearance of a real braid

##<h1>Step 6: Clean Up with Move Mode
1. Click <strong>Move<strong> mode
2. Adjust positions so crossings look natural
3. Use control points to smooth curves
4. Make the pattern consistent along the length

<strong>Result<strong>: You now have a realistic-looking three-strand braid!

#<h1>Tutorial 3: Creating Over/Under Effects with Masks

<strong>What we're making<strong>: Understanding how to make strands appear to weave over and under each other

##<h1>Understanding Masks
- Masks make parts of strands "invisible" 
- This creates the illusion that other strands pass in front
- Essential for realistic rope and knot effects

##<h1>Step 1: Create Two Crossing Strands
1. <strong>Attach<strong> mode: Draw one horizontal strand
2. <strong>Attach<strong> mode: Draw one vertical strand crossing the first
3. You now have an "X" shape with two layers

##<h1>Step 2: Basic Masking
1. Click <strong>Mask<strong> mode
2. Click on the vertical strand (Layer 2)
3. Notice how part of it disappears where it crosses the horizontal strand
4. This makes the horizontal strand appear to go "in front"

##<h1>Step 3: Switch the Effect
1. Still in <strong>Mask<strong> mode
2. Click on the horizontal strand (Layer 1) instead
3. Now the vertical strand appears to go in front
4. Click the same strand again to remove the mask

##<h1>Step 4: Practice with Multiple Strands
1. Add a third strand diagonally across both
2. Use <strong>Mask<strong> mode to create a pattern:
   - Strand 1 over Strand 2
   - Strand 2 over Strand 3  
   - Strand 3 over Strand 1
3. This creates a realistic woven effect

##<h1>Step 5: Fine-tuning Masks
1. Use <strong>Move<strong> mode to adjust positions
2. The mask effects stay with the strands as you move them
3. Use <strong>Mask<strong> mode again to add or remove effects

<strong>Key Point<strong>: Masking is what makes your drawings look like real rope work instead of just lines on paper.

#<h1>Tutorial 4: Working with Colors and Styles

<strong>What we're making<strong>: A colorful rope pattern with different strand styles

##<h1>Step 1: Change Default Colors
1. Click <strong>Settings<strong> ⚙️
2. Under <strong>Drawing Settings<strong>, find <strong>Default Colors<strong>
3. Click the colored squares to pick new colors:
   - <strong>Strand Color<strong>: The fill color (inside)
   - <strong>Stroke Color<strong>: The outline color
4. Click <strong>OK<strong>

##<h1>Step 2: Create Strands with New Colors
1. <strong>Attach<strong> mode: Draw a new strand
2. It will use your new default colors
3. Draw 2-3 more strands to see the effect

##<h1>Step 3: Change Individual Strand Colors
1. Click <strong>Select<strong> mode
2. Click on a strand you want to change
3. Look for color options in the interface
4. Choose different colors for that specific strand
5. Repeat for other strands

##<h1>Step 4: Adjust Strand Width
1. In <strong>Settings<strong>, find <strong>Strand Width<strong>
2. Try different values:
   - 30 = thin rope
   - 50 = medium rope  
   - 70 = thick rope
3. New strands will use the new width

##<h1>Step 5: Create a Rainbow Braid
1. Create 5 parallel strands
2. Make each strand a different color:
   - Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue
3. Use the braiding technique from Tutorial 2
4. The result is a colorful braided pattern

<strong>Tip<strong>: Use contrasting colors (light stroke on dark strand, or vice versa) to make your patterns more visible and attractive.

#<h1>Tutorial 5: Using the Grid for Precise Alignment

<strong>What we're making<strong>: A perfectly symmetrical knot pattern using the grid system

##<h1>Step 1: Enable the Grid
1. Click the <strong>Grid<strong> button in the toolbar
2. You'll see dots or lines appear on the canvas
3. These help you align strands precisely

##<h1>Step 2: Understanding Grid Snapping
1. <strong>Attach<strong> mode: Try drawing a strand
2. Notice how it "snaps" to grid points
3. This helps create neat, professional-looking patterns
4. The snapping works for start points, end points, and curves

##<h1>Step 3: Create a Symmetric Pattern
1. Draw the first strand from one grid point to another
2. Count the grid squares (e.g., 6 squares long)
3. Draw a second strand the exact same length
4. Use the grid to ensure perfect symmetry

##<h1>Step 4: Grid Settings
1. <strong>Settings<strong> → <strong>Drawing Settings<strong> → <strong>Grid<strong>
2. Adjust grid size:
   - Smaller = more precision
   - Larger = easier to see
3. Toggle "Snap to Grid" on/off as needed

##<h1>Step 5: When to Use the Grid
<strong>Good for:<strong>
- Geometric patterns
- Repeated elements  
- Professional diagrams
- Teaching materials

<strong>Not needed for:<strong>
- Organic, natural-looking ropes
- Artistic, flowing designs
- Quick sketches

#<h1>Tutorial 6: Managing Multiple Layers

<strong>What we're making<strong>: A complex knot with proper layer organization

##<h1>Understanding Layer Numbers
- Each strand gets a number (1, 2, 3...)
- Higher numbers appear "on top"
- Layer panel shows all your strands

##<h1>Step 1: Create Multiple Strands
1. Create 6-8 strands in a complex pattern
2. Notice how they're numbered in the layer panel
3. Each number is a clickable button

##<h1>Step 2: Selecting Layers
1. Click number <strong>3<strong> in the layer panel
2. Layer 3 becomes highlighted on the canvas
3. This is much easier than clicking on the canvas for complex patterns

##<h1>Step 3: Reordering Layers
1. In the layer panel, drag a layer button up or down
2. Watch how the strand moves forward or backward
3. Use this to control which strands appear in front

##<h1>Step 4: Hiding Layers Temporarily
1. Look for visibility controls in the layer panel
2. Hide some layers while working on others
3. This reduces visual clutter in complex projects

##<h1>Step 5: Layer Organization Strategy
<strong>For complex projects:<strong>
1. <strong>Bottom layers<strong>: Background elements, base structure
2. <strong>Middle layers<strong>: Main pattern elements
3. <strong>Top layers<strong>: Details, highlights, finishing touches

<strong>Naming convention<strong> (if available):
- Layer 1: "Base Loop"
- Layer 2: "Cross Over"  
- Layer 3: "Detail Strand"

#<h1>Tutorial 7: Creating Groups and Organization

<strong>What we're making<strong>: A complex pattern organized into manageable groups

##<h1>Step 1: Create a Multi-Part Pattern
1. Create one section with 3-4 strands (e.g., a knot)
2. Create another section with 3-4 strands (e.g., a braid)
3. You now have 6-8 layers total

##<h1>Step 2: Create Your First Group
1. Select multiple layers that belong together:
   - Click layer 1
   - Hold Ctrl/Cmd and click layer 2, 3, etc.
2. Look for a "Create Group" option
3. Name the group (e.g., "Knot Section")

##<h1>Step 3: Working with Groups
1. Click on the group name to select the whole group
2. Use <strong>Move<strong> mode to move the entire group together
3. Groups make it easy to manage complex patterns

##<h1>Step 4: Group Organization Tips
<strong>Good grouping strategies:<strong>
- Group by function: "Base", "Crossings", "Details"
- Group by color: "Red Strands", "Blue Strands"  
- Group by position: "Left Side", "Right Side"

##<h1>Step 5: Expanding Complex Projects
1. Create multiple groups for different parts
2. Work on one group at a time
3. Hide other groups while focusing
4. This keeps large projects manageable

#<h1>Common Problems and Solutions

##<h1>Problem: "My strands don't look like rope"
<strong>Solution<strong>: Use the <strong>Mask<strong> mode to create over/under effects. Without masking, strands just look like lines on paper.

##<h1>Problem: "I can't select the strand I want"
<strong>Solution<strong>: Use the layer panel numbers instead of clicking on the canvas. It's much more precise.

##<h1>Problem: "My pattern looks messy"
<strong>Solution<strong>: 
1. Turn on the <strong>Grid<strong> for better alignment
2. Use <strong>Move<strong> mode to clean up positions
3. Adjust control points for smoother curves

##<h1>Problem: "I accidentally deleted something"
<strong>Solution<strong>: Use the <strong>Undo<strong> button (↶) to go back steps. Every action is saved.

##<h1>Problem: "The strands are too thick/thin"
<strong>Solution<strong>: Go to <strong>Settings<strong> → <strong>Drawing Settings<strong> → <strong>Strand Width<strong> and adjust the value.

##<h1>Problem: "I can't see my work clearly"
<strong>Solution<strong>: 
1. Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out
2. Try different colors in <strong>Settings<strong>
3. Consider changing the theme

##<h1>Problem: "My file won't save"
<strong>Solution<strong>: 
1. Make sure you have write permissions to the folder
2. Try saving to your Desktop or Documents folder
3. Avoid special characters in the filename

#<h1>Tips for Better Results

##<h1>Drawing Technique
1. <strong>Start simple<strong>: Begin with basic shapes, add complexity later
2. <strong>Use control points<strong>: Don't just drag strands - adjust the curves for natural flow
3. <strong>Plan your layers<strong>: Think about what goes over what before you start

##<h1>Visual Quality
1. <strong>Contrast is key<strong>: Use different colors or thick outlines to separate strands
2. <strong>Consistent width<strong>: Keep strand thickness consistent within each "rope"
3. <strong>Smooth curves<strong>: Use control points to eliminate sharp angles

##<h1>Workflow Efficiency  
1. <strong>Save frequently<strong>: Use <strong>Save<strong> after each major step
2. <strong>Use groups<strong>: Organize complex patterns from the beginning
3. <strong>Grid for precision<strong>: Turn on when you need exact alignment
4. <strong>Layers for selection<strong>: Use layer numbers instead of hunting on canvas

##<h1>Project Planning
1. <strong>Sketch first<strong>: Plan your pattern on paper before starting
2. <strong>Reference photos<strong>: Look at real knots and ropes for inspiration
3. <strong>Start with samples<strong>: Load example projects to learn techniques

#<h1>Professional Project Planning

##<h1>Before Starting Any Major Project

<strong>Research Phase:<strong>
1. <strong>Gather reference materials<strong>: Photos of real knots, technical diagrams, historical examples
2. <strong>Identify the key elements<strong>: What makes this knot unique? Which crossings are critical?
3. <strong>Plan the viewing angle<strong>: Top view? Side view? 3D perspective?
4. <strong>Choose your audience<strong>: Beginners need simple, clear diagrams; experts can handle complexity

<strong>Project Scope Planning:<strong>
1. <strong>Estimate layer count<strong>: Simple knots = 3-8 layers, Complex patterns = 20-50 layers
2. <strong>Plan your color scheme<strong>: Will you need different colors for different rope sections?
3. <strong>Determine final output<strong>: Screen display, print publication, educational poster?
4. <strong>Set quality standards<strong>: How precise do measurements need to be?

##<h1>Advanced File Organization

#<h1>Advanced Knot Construction Techniques

##<h1>The Professional Approach to Knot Drawing

###<h1>Phase 1: Foundation Structure
1. <strong>Identify the core loop<strong>: Every knot has a basic underlying structure
2. <strong>Draw the primary path<strong>: Create the main rope path without worrying about crossings
3. <strong>Mark crossing points<strong>: Note where the rope crosses over itself
4. <strong>Plan the layer hierarchy<strong>: Which sections go over/under others

###<h1>Phase 2: Systematic Construction
1. <strong>Build from bottom up<strong>: Start with strands that go "under" everything else
2. <strong>Add middle layers<strong>: Strands that have some over/under relationships  
3. <strong>Finish with top layers<strong>: Strands that go "over" most other elements
4. <strong>Refine systematically<strong>: Work through each layer, perfecting curves and positions

##<h1>Advanced Masking Strategies

<strong>Complex Over/Under Patterns:<strong>
1. <strong>Map the crossings<strong>: Draw a simple diagram showing every crossing point
2. <strong>Number the crossings<strong>: 1, 2, 3... to track which you've completed
3. <strong>Apply masks systematically<strong>: Work through your numbered list
4. <strong>Test the logic<strong>: Follow the rope path to ensure it's physically possible

<strong>Multiple Rope Knots:<strong>
1. <strong>Color-code during construction<strong>: Use temporary colors to track different ropes
2. <strong>Build one rope at a time<strong>: Complete all layers for rope 1, then rope 2, etc.
3. <strong>Coordinate the interactions<strong>: Plan how different ropes cross each other
4. <strong>Unify colors at the end<strong>: Change all ropes to final colors when structure is complete

#<h1>Creating Publication-Quality Diagrams

##<h1>Technical Illustration Standards

<strong>Consistency Requirements:<strong>
- <strong>Uniform strand width<strong>: All ropes of same type must be identical thickness
- <strong>Consistent color coding<strong>: Same colors mean same things throughout
- <strong>Standardized spacing<strong>: Equal gaps between parallel strands
- <strong>Aligned elements<strong>: Use grid religiously for professional appearance

<strong>Visual Hierarchy:<strong>
1. <strong>Primary elements<strong>: Main rope structure - highest contrast
