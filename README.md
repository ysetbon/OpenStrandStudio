# OpenStrand Studio - Version 1.104

An advanced diagramming tool for creating tutorials involving strand manipulation (knots, hitches, etc.)
with dynamic masking that automatically adjusts the over-under effects between strands,
making complex patterns clear and easy to understand.

## What's New in Version 1.104

- **Initial Setup**: When first starting the application, you'll need to click "New Strand" to begin creating your first strand.
