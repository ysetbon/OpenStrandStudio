# Move Mode Changes Summary

## Overview
The move mode has been refactored to use LayerStateManager connections exclusively instead of proximity-based distance calculations.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Added Connection Query Methods
- `get_connected_strands(strand_name, connection_point)`: Gets all strands connected to a specific point
- `gather_moving_strands(initial_strand, moving_point)`: Recursively gathers all strands that should move together
- `parse_connection_string(connection_str)`: Parses connection strings from LayerStateManager
- `build_connection_cache()` and `invalidate_connection_cache()`: Performance optimization methods

### 2. Updated `start_movement` Method
- Replaced proximity-based strand gathering with `gather_moving_strands()` using LayerStateManager
- Removed all `points_are_close()` checks for determining which strands move together
- Now uses connection data format: `strand_name: [start_connection(endpoint), end_connection(endpoint)]`

### 3. Updated `update_strand_position` Method
- Replaced proximity checks with `get_connected_strands()` calls
- Connected strands are now moved based on their connection endpoints from LayerStateManager
- Removed redundant proximity-based attached strand checks

### 4. Simplified `find_connected_strand` Method
- Now directly uses `get_connected_strands()` instead of proximity checks
- Returns the first connected strand from LayerStateManager data

## Remaining Work

### Still Using Proximity (needs update):
1. Line 1428-1431: In `mouseReleaseEvent` - determining which end is connected
2. Line 2931-2937: In connection cache building - needs to use LayerStateManager instead

### Testing Required:
1. Simple attachment: Move strand with one attached strand
2. Multiple attachments: Move strand with multiple attached strands
3. Chain attachments: Move any strand in a chain
4. Closed knots: Ensure all strands in a knot move together

## Benefits Achieved
- Consistent behavior based on LayerStateManager connections
- No more proximity-based false positives
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Single source of truth for strand relationships

## Example Usage
When moving strand 1_1 with connections `1_1: ['1_3(0)', '1_2(0)']`:
- Moving 1_1's start will also move 1_3's start
- Moving 1_1's end will also move 1_2's start
- All movement is determined by LayerStateManager, not by proximity
