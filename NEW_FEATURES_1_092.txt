========================
need to be implementation:

- Added saving and loading of undo/redo states to persist user actions across sessions.
- Introduced dashed lines and arrows:
  • Configurable dash patterns on both ends of strands
  • Dashed arrowheads at strand endpoints
- Enhanced control point visuals:
  • Larger moving squares
  • Distinct colors for control points per strand
- Added option in settings to toggle mask extension behavior.
- Improved shading algorithm:
  • Exposed shading controls in user settings
- Enhanced layer panel interactions:
  • Drag-and-drop support for layers
  • Hidden layer option in right-click context menu
  • Line ending drawing and hide/show via right-click panel

======================================  
For about in user settings: 

- Undo/Redo State Persistence:
  • Undo/redo history is now preserved when saving your work. When you loading a saved file, you can continue using undo/redo as if you never closed the application.
- Dashed Lines and Arrows:
  • Configurable dash patterns at both ends of each strand, with adjustable dash count, length, and spacing for clear visual demarcation.
  • Dashed arrowheads at strand endpoints, offering fine-tuned control over head length, width, gap, and shaft settings in the Settings dialog.
- Enhanced Control Point Visuals:
  • Control points have been enlarged for easier grabbing.
  • Each handle now sports a distinct border and a filled center matching its strand's color for immediate visual association.
- Mask Extension Behavior:
  • A new toggle in the Settings dialog lets you choose whether masks clip at strand endpoints or extend seamlessly beyond them, giving you precise control over mask behavior.
- Improved Shading Algorithm:
  • The shading engine now recalculates fresh shadow paths with multi-buffer soft-edge feathering and high-quality antialiasing, eliminates aliasing, and exposes new settings controls for shadow blur steps, max blur radius, directly in the Settings dialog.
- Enhanced Layer Panel Interactions:
  • Drag-and-drop reordering with visual drop indicators.
  • Right-click context menu with new visibility toggles:
    - Show/hide strand lines
    - Show/hide arrowheads
    - Show/hide strand circles
