# Checkbox Improvements in Settings Dialog

## Summary of Changes

The checkbox (toggle) buttons in the user settings dialog have been improved for better quality and user experience.

### Changes Made:

1. **Increased Size**: Checkbox indicators increased from 13px × 13px to 22px × 22px
2. **Better Styling**: Added proper borders, rounded corners, and hover effects
3. **Theme Support**: Different styling for light and dark themes

5. **Improved Spacing**: Better spacing between checkbox and label (10px)
6. **Larger Font**: Text font size increased to 14px for better readability
7. **✅ VISIBLE CHECKMARK**: Clear, visible checkmark (✓) using system fonts - no external dependencies

### Technical Details:

- **Location**: `src/settings_dialog.py` 
- **Method**: `apply_checkbox_style()` - new method to handle checkbox styling
- **Integration**: Applied in both `organize_widgets_for_rtl()` and `apply_dialog_theme()` methods
- **Affected Checkboxes**:
  - Draw only affected strand when dragging
  - Enable third control point at center
  - **Enable snap to grid** (newly added)
  - Default arrow color checkbox
  - Any other checkboxes in the settings dialog

### Visual Improvements:

#### Light Theme:
- White background with gray border
- **GREEN background when checked with prominent white checkmark ✓**
- Subtle hover effects with darker green
- Clean modern appearance

#### Dark Theme:
- Dark background with lighter borders
- **GREEN background when checked with prominent white checkmark ✓**
- Proper contrast for dark environments
- White text color

#### Checkmark Details:
- **Character**: Unicode ✓ (check mark)
- **Font**: Arial, 12px, Bold
- **Color**: Pure white (#ffffff) for contrast against green background
- **Position**: Centered in checkbox indicator
- **Method**: Custom paintEvent - no external dependencies

### User Experience Benefits:

1. **Better Accessibility**: Larger click targets (22px vs 13px)
2. **Higher Quality**: Professional modern appearance
3. **Consistent Theming**: Proper support for both light and dark themes
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear hover states and animations
5. **Improved Readability**: Larger text and better spacing

### Usage:

The improvements are automatically applied to all checkboxes in the settings dialog. No additional configuration is needed - the larger, higher-quality checkboxes will appear immediately when the settings dialog is opened.

### Code Structure:

```python
def apply_checkbox_style(self):
    """Apply checkbox styling based on current theme"""
    # Theme-specific styling for checkboxes
    # Applied to all QCheckBox widgets in the dialog
```

The styling is automatically applied when:
- The dialog opens
- The theme changes
- The language/RTL setting changes

All toggle buttons in the user settings now have consistent, high-quality appearance that matches the application's design standards.
