# OpenStrand Studio

OpenStrand Studio is an interactive tool for creating and manipulating strand-based designs. It provides a canvas where users can draw, connect, and modify strands to create complex patterns or structures. The software offers various modes for attaching, moving, and customizing strands, making it versatile for different design needs.

Created by Yonatan Setbon, owner of the YouTube channel LanYarD.

## Key Features:
- Attach Mode: Create new strands and connect them
- Move Mode: Adjust the position and shape of existing strands
- Layer Panel: Manage and organize your strands
- Color Customization: Change colors of individual strands or sets
- Grid System: Snap strands to a grid for precise placement

## IMPORTANT: Control Button Functionality

The Control button enables a crucial feature in OpenStrand Studio: the ability to create masked layers. When you hold down the Control key, you enter "Masked Mode". In this mode, you can select two existing layers, and the software will create a new masked layer that represents the intersection of these two layers. This powerful feature allows for complex designs and interactions between different parts of your strand structure.

To use this feature:
1. Hold down the Control key
2. Click on two different layers in your design
3. Release the Control key to create the masked layer

The masked layer feature is essential for creating intricate, overlapping designs and is one of the most powerful tools in OpenStrand Studio. Make sure to experiment with this functionality to unlock the full potential of your strand designs!
