# OpenStrand Studio - Version 1.100

An advanced diagramming tool for creating tutorials involving strand manipulation (knots, hitches, etc.)
with dynamic masking that automatically adjusts the over-under effects between strands, 
making complex patterns clear and easy to understand.

## What's New in Version 1.100

### ✨ New Features

- **Strand Width Control**: Dynamically adjust the width of individual strands, giving you more flexibility in creating varied knot designs.

- **Zoom In/Out**: Zoom in and out of your design to see small details or the entire diagram.
