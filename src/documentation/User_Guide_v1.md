## What is OpenStrand Studio?

OpenStrand Studio is a specialized drawing application designed for creating rope patterns, knots, braids, and strand-based artwork. Think of it as a digital tool for drawing anything that involves interwoven or connected strands - like nautical knots, macramé patterns, Celtic knots, or textile designs.

**Perfect for:**
- Rope and knot enthusiasts
- Textile and craft designers  
- Educational materials for knot-tying
- Decorative pattern creation
- Technical rope work documentation

## Getting Started

### First Launch
When you open OpenStrand Studio, you'll see:
- A toolbar at the top with various buttons
- A large drawing area (canvas) in the center
- A panel on the right side for managing layers
- Everything starts empty, ready for your first creation

### Your First Stroke
1. Click the **"Attach"** button (first button on the left)
2. Click and drag on the canvas to draw your first strand
3. You'll see a curved line appear - this is your first strand!

## Understanding the Interface

The interface is divided into three main areas:
